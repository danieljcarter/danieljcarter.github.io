Hi - I'm Daniel. I'm a quantitative social epidemiologist, currently based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine where I am a [Research Fellow](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/carter.daniel). I trained as a medical statistician and now work using applied statistics to better understand health inequities.

My particular research interests include the use of causal inference in social epidemiology, the social and structural drivers of HIV and TB, and critical realism (including realist reviews). I am also completing a part-time PhD at the intersection of these topics with [Delia Boccia](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/boccia.delia), [Kara Rudolph](https://kararudolph.github.io/), and [James Hargreaves](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/hargreaves.james). In my other life I direct (and occasionally write) for the theatre, read a lot, and am learning to play the viola.
